A fun block for displaying a random "Powered By" message.

== Description ==

A block that generates a random "Powered by" message. It is meant to replace the typical "Powered by Theme/WordPress" message in footers but can be used anywhere.

Some examples:

> Powered by coffee.
> Powered by crazy ideas and passion.
> Powered by heart and soul.

The default messages are shown in plain text, but you can "emojify" them, like so:

> Powered by ‚òï.
> Powered by crazy ü§î and passion.
> Powered by ‚ù§Ô∏è and soul.

== Changelog ==

Please see the `changelog.md` file included with the plugin file.  Or, you can view the [online change log](https://github.com/x3p0-dev/x3p0-powered-by/blob/master/changelog.md).
