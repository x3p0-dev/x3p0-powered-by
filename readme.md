# X3P0 Powered By

A block that generates a random "Powered by" message. It is meant to replace the typical "Powered by Theme/WordPress" message in footers but can be used anywhere.

Some examples:

> Powered by coffee.
> Powered by crazy ideas and passion.
> Powered by heart and soul.

The default messages are shown in plain text, but you can "emojify" them, like so:

> Powered by ‚òï.
> Powered by crazy ü§î and passion.
> Powered by ‚ù§Ô∏è and soul.
