# X3P0 Powered By

A block that generates a random "Powered by" message. It is meant to replace the typical "Powered by Theme/WordPress" message in footers but can be used anywhere.

Some examples:

- Powered by coffee.
- Powered by crazy ideas and passion.
- Powered by heart and soul.

The default messages are shown in plain text, but you can "emojify" them, like so:

- Powered by ☕.
- Powered by crazy 🤔 and passion.
- Powered by ❤️ and soul.
